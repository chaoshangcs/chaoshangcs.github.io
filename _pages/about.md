I am an Applied Scientist at [Amazon AWS AI](https://www.amazon.science/). 
My research interests lie primarily in deep graph learning, NLP and machine learning using large-scale graph-structured and text datasets, with an emphasis on knowledge graphs, question answering, taxonomy construction, healthcare informatics, and drug discovery.

Before joining Amazon, I was a Research Scientist at JD AI Research. I received my Ph.D. from the Computer Science and Engineering Department, [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu/), advised by [Prof. Jinbo Bi](http://www.engr.uconn.edu/~jinbo/). I got my M.S. degree at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT). I also have spent some time interning in MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, JD AI Research and University of Southern California.
