I am a research scientist at [JD AI Research](https://air.jd.com/), [JD.COM](https://corporate.jd.com/home), working closely with [Dr. Jing Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ocPXoIkAAAAJ&hl=en).
I received my Ph.D. from the Computer Science and Engineering Department, [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu/), advised by [Prof. Jinbo Bi](http://www.engr.uconn.edu/~jinbo/). I got my M.S. degree at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT). I also have spent some time interning in [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/) (2014), [JD AI Research](http://air.jd.com/) (2018), [IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center](http://research.ibm.com/labs/watson/) (2019) and [MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab](https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/) (2020).

My primary research interests are in deep graph learning ( Graph Neural Networks ) and machine learning using large-scale graph-structured datasets, with an emphasis on knowledge graphs, taxonomy construction, healthcare informatics, social networks, and drug discovery.
